Takis Meeting Notes 28/05/205

grab all of the melanoma datasets that you can

human and mouse

scRNAseq and bulk RNAseq... and heck.. scATAC and spatial RNAseq, where it exists

focus on changes in stroma and immune system between distal metastases

before and after immunotherapy, focusing on macrophages

question about innate immunity that doesn't have memory. innate system has
metabolic memory. in the more relevant studies, what happens in human in immune
cells, like NK cells, macrophages, before and after therapy... make a small atlas
and extrapolate different signatures. trained immune score that was developed. 

CAR-monocyte therapy... expos monocytes to specific pathogens... put back in human patients

be precise what we are checking. we can also look into spatial

access to biobank to process for single cell from ffp samples.

biopsy before and after immunotherapy. up to 6x patient samples.

single cell in patient metastatis, cross-organ.

Bonus: intuition behind GSEA
