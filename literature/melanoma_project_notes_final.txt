I am a melanoma researcher and my latest project entails integrating all publicly available melanoma datasets for human and mouse, including both primary and metastatic tumors. I am primarily interested in scRNAseq and bulk RNAseq datasets, but later on, I also intend to integrate scATAC, spatial RNAseq and ChIPseq datasets, as well.

focus on changes in stroma and immune system between distal metastases

before and after immunotherapy, focusing on macrophages

question about innate immunity that doesn't have memory. innate system has
metabolic memory. in the more relevant studies, what happens in human in immune
cells, like NK cells, macrophages, before and after therapy... make a small atlas
and extrapolate different signatures. trained immune score that was developed. 

CAR-monocyte therapy... expos monocytes to specific pathogens... put back in human patients

be precise what we are checking. we can also look into spatial

access to biobank to process for single cell from ffp samples.

biopsy before and after immunotherapy. up to 6x patient samples.

single cell in patient metastatis, cross-organ.
